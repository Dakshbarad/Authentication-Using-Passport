Documentation:

This is a personal project which is a nodejs app.

*Idea:
The project is supposed to allow users to insert how their day went in terms of studying, workingOut or sleeping and gives them thier average statistics based on their data.
 
The web app also gives the average statistics of a person based on all the users that are using the app.

It also allows users to add friends and compare their daily progress with them.

*Till now:

30/09/2020:
I have added the user authentication using passport-local. So people can register and login into their account using the credentials.
I am using mongodb as a database to store the user data.
